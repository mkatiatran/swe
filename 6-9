cloning is copying a project for the first time, it can only happen once
you cannot clone again to the same place

when you write a program you start with the unittests first


everything in python is an object
123 is an instance of type int
"abc" is an instance of type string

string, int are classes

all objects have to be instantiated

in python, there are two categories at the top: TYPE, and OBJECT
in java, only object is at the top


notation              
this is an object

examples
123, object only, pure object
type
object
anything in python
int, a class object
str, a class object

this is the type of A
^
|
this is object A

int
^
|
123

this is the super class of C
^
|
this is class C


Foo
^
|
Bar
this means bar is a subclass of Foo




object
^
|| (dashed line)
Foo ---> type

two pointers from Foo, one to superclass and one to type
type(Foo) gives you the type
__base__ will tell you the superclass




type is going to tell you what class something was instantiated from


lists are mutable, you can change the data structure wo generating a new one
tuples are immutable, any attempt to change you create a new object
sets are mutable and unordered, duplicates are not allowed
frozen set is immutable
dictionary has key value pairs





** to consider for project 1
