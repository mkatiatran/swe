wait no more than 2 months to release a version of the software

release often so customers can use product often to deliver most value in shortest time
with greatest confidence and low stress

3 phases: exploration, commitment, and steering
releases are made up of iterations, where each iteration implements a story, made up of tasks

in exploration, you write stories and define what the system needs to do
experiment with how to build the system, try experiments that inform you of how costly the various stories and featuers will be


release plan:
write enough stories
do exploration
estimate story difficulty
estimate speed of story implemetation
choose stories for the first release from business value and difficulty

iteration planning steps
customer presents their stories
team brainstorms the work per story
programmers sign up for work and their estimates
