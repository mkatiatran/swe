git init - creates a new git repository
git clone - creates a working copy of a repository
  - LOCAL, use git clone /path/to/repository
  - on a remote server, clone to local device, use git clone username@host:/path/to/repository

local repository consists of three trees
working directory - holds actual files
index - staging area
head - points to the last commit you've made

git add <filename> adds a file to the index
git commit -m "message" commits file to the head, but the file is not in the remote repository
git push origin master/branch name - sends changes to the remote repository

git checkout -b branch_name - creates a new branch named branch_name and switches to it
git checkout master - switches back to masater
git branch -d branch_name - deletes branch_name
git push origin branch_name - pushes branch to remote repo

git pull - updates local repo to newest commit
git merge branch_name - merges another branch into your active branch
git diff source_branch_name target_branch_name - shows difference between the two branches

git log - shows repo history
git log --name-status - shows you which files have changed
git checkout -- file_name - this replaces the changes in your current tree with the last content in head

git reset --hard origin/master - drops all local changes and commits, fetches latest history from server and points local master branch to it
