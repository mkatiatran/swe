lambda x: x+1
def f(x):
  return x+1


switching [] to () turns an object into an iterator, where before it was iterable

y=map(lambda v:v*5, x)
  this means apply this transformation to every element in x
the map function is iterator, iterable

iterable has iter
iterator has next
indexable has getnext
count has count



x=[2,3,4]
y=(v*5 for v in x)
y is a generator
x+=[5]      adds 5 to the end of x list, because y is a generator 
list(y) = [10,15,20,25]
list(y) = []
x+=[5]
list(y) = []

iterator is lazy, exhaustible

if y has square brackets, it is eager and not lazy and only sticks to [2,3,4]



filter(lambda v:v%2,x)
filters x to only odd values

|= is the union function where you combine elements of two lists
set
dictionary comprehension






what is considered true in python
assert all([])
assert all([
    A(),
    True,
    2,
    3.45,
    "abc",
    [2, 3, 4],
    (2, 3, 4),
    {2, 3, 4},
    {2 : "abc", 3 : "def", 4 : "ghi"}])




assert not any([])
assert not any([B(), False, 0, 0.0,  "", [], (), set(), {}])
