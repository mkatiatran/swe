def __call__

this makes a class callable 
"magic function"



reduce(function, iterable, initializer)

function: This is the function that will be applied cumulatively to the items of the iterable. It should take two arguments and return a single value.
iterable: This is the sequence of elements to be processed.
initializer: This is an optional argument that provides an initial value. If it is not specified, 
reduce() uses the first element of the iterable as the initial value and starts the cumulative 
computation from the second element.



object.function from a class = method type, passes self implicitly as parameter
class.function = function type, does not pass self implicity as parameter




regex

re.compile("^a", re.M)
splits the string into lines with the first instance of an a, excluding the first character

^a beginning of line
b$ end of line


re.split(".") means split around any character except a newline
r"\d" means any digit, r means it's a raw string and to avoid collision with escape sequence
\D means any nondigit
\w any alpha numeric
\W any nonalpha numeric

? means 0 or 1 only
+ means 1 or more
* means 0 or more
m = re.search("(a*)b([^a]*)(a*)b",s)
0 or more a's, followed by 1 b, followed by anything but a, zero or more, followed by 0 or more a's, followed by a b

Group 0: It represents the entire match or the entire string that matched the pattern.
Group 1: It represents the first group of parentheses in the pattern.
Group 2: It represents the second group of parentheses in the pattern.
Group 3: It represents the third group of parentheses in the pattern.



re.sub = replace all instances of first param with second param in string

relational algebra
algebra
- elements = relations/tables
- operations = select, project, many joins

integers under +, -, *, /
integers are closed under +, -, *
all of these are closed

emulate the functionality of these operations in python
