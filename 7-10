"magic function"



reduce(function, iterable, initializer)

function: This is the function that will be applied cumulatively to the items of the iterable. It should take two arguments and return a single value.
iterable: This is the sequence of elements to be processed.
initializer: This is an optional argument that provides an initial value. If it is not specified, 
reduce() uses the first element of the iterable as the initial value and starts the cumulative 
computation from the second element.



object.function from a class = method type, passes self implicitly as parameter
class.function = function type, does not pass self implicity as parameter
