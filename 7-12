relational algebra 
  - select(table, unary predicate) -> whittles down rows
  - project -> returns subset of columns but all rows
  - lots of joins

this is closed, meaning you always get back a table
poor man's implementation bc you cannot represent what you really want
  - no set of sets, set of dictionaries..

project(r, "a", "b")
  - you get table r, but remove a, b

crossjoin(r,s) -> a table r
  - marries every row of r to every row of s
