if making a file, to add it back to main

git checkout main - switches back to main brange
git merge name-of-branch - merges other brange with main, you must resolve any conflicts if necessary
git push origin main - pushes new changes to remote repo
git branch -d name-of-branch - delete the branch if you will not use any more



merge conflicts:
<<<<<<< HEAD
def fun2():
pass
=======
def fun1():
pass
>>>>>>>

if you intend to keep both fun2 and fun1, delete the <<, ==, and >> which show the regions of the file with the conflict


merge requests:
from local to your copy on the cloud, you can push changes from a branch; then using gitlab, request merging the branch to main 
you can also merge your forked copy to the original copy (after pushing locally)
