if making a file, to add it back to main

git checkout main - switches back to main brange
git merge name-of-branch - merges other brange with main, you must resolve any conflicts if necessary
git push origin main - pushes new changes to remote repo
git branch -d name-of-branch - delete the branch if you will not use any more
