integration verified by automated build to detect integration errors asap
integration is a long, unpredictable process
it can be quick when you integrate daily against a controlled source repository

best continuous integration server is cruisecontrol

steps:
check out a working copy
alter the code as you see vit
build on local machine, make sure it's good
update local copy to remote changes
  if error, fix and repeat
commit to mainline
build code remotely
when it succeeds, you are done

result: stable software that works, has few bugs

repositories
  put all files in there
  keep branches to a minimum
  don't keep the products of the build in the repository

automate the build
  a good build tool checks dates of the source/object files, only compiles if the
  source date is later
  
make the code self-testing
  use automated tests that can be run from a single command
  for a build to be self-testing, failure of 1 test causes build to fail

commit to the mainline daily
  conflicts can be found easily
  
build the mainline on an integration machine
  don't go home until mainline builds with any commits you've added
  can do this manually or using a CI server
  manually, go to the integration machine and execute the integration build
  CI monitors the repository, every commit the server initiates a build and notifies 
  the person who submitted it of the result

fix the build immediately

deployment pipeline
  there are multiple builds done in sequence
  first commit triggers the first build/commit build, is done quickly
  
a two-stage deployment pipeline
  do the compilation, run tests with database stubbed out, this will run very fast, < 10 min
  then, run the build with a range of dif tests that do hit the real database, may take a couple hours
  if the second stage fails this does not have the same "stop everyone" quality
  
test in a clone of the production environment
  fush out any problem the system will have in production
  use the same database software, same OS version
  use a virtual machine

easy access for anyone to get the latest executable
  
biggest benefit
  reduced risk
