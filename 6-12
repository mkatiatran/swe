python
>>> range(1, 10, 2)
>>> list(range(1, 10, 2))
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

range is a generator like object

mutable vs immutable

a = [1, 2, 3]
list = [1, 2, 3]

highly recommended NOT to use list as name of a list because it will cause an error
  you redefine list to be an object instead of a function
  
lists are mutable objects and can store many types of objects

you cannot change objects in tuples, bc it does not support item assignment
